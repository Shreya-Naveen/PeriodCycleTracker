Project: Cycle Tracker 

This is a Cycle Tracker application built using Django, which allows users to log details about their menstrual cycle and health metrics through a simple, styled web form.

---->Features of the Cycle Tracker:

1. Cycle Tracker Form:
   
Users can fill out a form with the following details:

Cycle length.

Last period start date.

Symptoms like cramps, mood, and fatigue.

Hydration level.

Sleep quality and performance metrics.

The form dynamically updates insights based on user input.

2. Styling with CSS:

The page has a clean and visually appealing design:

A light pink background to make the form aesthetically pleasing.

A centered form with rounded corners, padding, and subtle shadows for a professional look.

Insights displayed in colorful, styled list items for easy readability.

---->Possible Use Cases:

Health and Fitness Tracking:Users can log their menstrual cycle and health metrics to optimize their workout routines, diet, and daily activities.

Medical Support:This could assist users in identifying patterns that may be useful for medical consultations (e.g., irregular cycles, low hydration).

Wellness Insights:Helps users understand how their daily behaviors impact their overall health and well-being.

---->Next Steps for Improvement:

Add a Dashboard:
A page showing historical cycle data and trends with graphs and charts.

Authentication:
Allow users to create accounts so they can log their data privately.

Mobile Optimization:
Ensure the app is fully responsive for mobile devices.

Integration:
Add integrations with APIs like fitness trackers or health apps (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health).
